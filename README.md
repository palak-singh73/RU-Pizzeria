Create an RU Pizza application that would we used to manage the orders for a pizzeria. The software should allow you to take, place, and cancel orders.
The pizzeria should order five specialty pizzas (deluxe, supreme, meatzza, seafood, and pepperoni) and the option for the customer to build their own. For "build your own" pizza, the user should be able to select between 3 and 7 toppings and their selection of sauce. All pizzas should also include the option for extra sauce and/or cheese for $1 extra. Each order is uniquely identified by an order number. However, for simplicity's sake, do not keep track of the dates and customer information of the orders.
